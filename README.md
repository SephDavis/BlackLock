# BlackLock
BlackLock explores the use of Ring Learning with Rounding (RLWR) for post-quantum secure communication, with potential applications in VPN security. This conceptual project focuses on efficient key generation, encryption, and decryption using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for quantum-resistant encryption.

## About
Developed by Toby Davis, BlackLock is a conceptual project designed to explore innovative applications of RLWR in post-quantum cryptography. While this is not a fully working algorithm, it provides a foundation for research into secure communication technologies resistant to the threats posed by quantum computing.

## Disclaimer
BlackLock is a conceptual project designed for educational and exploratory purposes, representing one of several versions I have developed. While this version reflects what I believe to be the most promising approach, it is not a fully implemented or production-ready encryption algorithm. Use of this project should be approached cautiously, and extensive testing is necessary before any practical application.

### Why Donâ€™t I Publish It?

BlackLock is still a conceptual project, and while I believe it demonstrates promising ideas, it has not undergone the rigorous testing and validation necessary for public adoption or practical use. Publishing it as a finalized encryption algorithm without sufficient peer review or security vetting could lead to misuse or implementation in critical systems without adequate safeguards.  

Additionally, as this project is intended for educational and exploratory purposes, I aim to refine its design and explore potential improvements before considering formal publication. By sharing it in its current form, I hope to inspire collaboration and further research while ensuring that its limitations are fully understood.
