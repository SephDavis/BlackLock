# BlackLock
BlackLock explores the use of Ring Learning with Rounding (RLWR) for post-quantum secure communication, with potential applications in VPN security. This conceptual project focuses on efficient key generation, encryption, and decryption using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for quantum-resistant encryption.
